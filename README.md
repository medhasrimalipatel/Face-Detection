# Face Detection Program

This project is a simple face detection program using OpenCV in Python. It loads a pre-trained Haar cascade model to detect faces in an image.

## Features
- Loads an image and detects faces.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces.
- Displays the processed image.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before running the program:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
